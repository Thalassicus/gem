			<Text>Trade originated with the start of communication in prehistoric times. It spurred common curiosity, ingenuity, and the learning of languages. As such, trade and the specialization that it engendered has been credited with accelerating the growth of human consciousness and humans’ triumph over the Neanderthal species.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is evidence of the exchange of obsidian and flint during the Stone Age. Egypt traded for materials used for creating jewelry since 3000 BCE. Long-range trade routes first appeared when the Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. The Phoenicians - noted sea traders - traveled across the Mediterranean Sea, and as far north as Britain for sources of tin to manufacture bronze. They established trade colonies the Greeks called emporia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Trade continued to drive the human tendency to explore long after the demise of the ancient Mediterranean maritime empires. Long-distance trade spread even farther with the Zheng He’s huge fleet, which reached India, Arabia and East Africa before Columbus crossed the ocean.</Text>
