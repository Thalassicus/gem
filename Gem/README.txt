=== Project Organization ===

The project is a branching tree:

1) Roots	(civup core)		depends on nothing.
2) Trunk	(civup tools)		depends on the roots (core) and other trunk parts (tools).
3) Branches	(civup interface)	depends on the trunk (tools) but not other branches.
4) Bark		(civup text)		depends on what it is attached to (roots, trunk, or branches).
5) Leaves	(G&K Enhanced Mod)	depends on all the parts above.
